Version 0.1.2
  Changes:
    - Rewrite of the locomotive pairing algorithm.  "Basic MU Control" now can pair locomotives which are separated only by other locomotives.
	- Added support for "Wireless MU Control", which can pair locomotives anywhere in the train.  L-W-W-L works now!
	- Added support for two-tiered tech unlocks.  Researching tech will not automatically upgrade existing trains because that would potentially destroy moving trains.
	- Moved the mapping of standard and buffed locomotive versions to a dummy technology per Optera's suggestion.
TODO:
 - Make decent icons for the technologies
 - Add RET support using the new remote interface functions
 - Remove a shit ton of debug text, but not all, so we can tell if it gets stuck in a loop again.
 - For Bulk Rail Loader, find a sorting string that puts them on the top line of Logistics instead of the train line, and suggest it to the author.
