Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2019-03-24
  Features:
    - "Basic MU Control" now can pair locomotives which are separated only by other locomotives.
    - Added "Wireless MU Control" mode, which can pair locomotives anywhere in the train.  L-W-W-L works now!

  Changes:
    - Rewrite of the locomotive pairing algorithms.
    - Moved the mapping of standard and buffed locomotive versions to a dummy technology per Optera's suggestion. Makes adding support for other mods much easier.
