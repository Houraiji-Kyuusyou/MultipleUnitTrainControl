Version 0.1.2
  Changes:
    - Rewrite of the locomotive pairing algorithm.  "Basic MU Control" now can pair locomotives which are separated only by other locomotives.
	- Added support for "Wireless MU Control", which can pair locomotives anywhere in the train.  L-W-W-L works now!
	- Added support for two technology tiers.  Researching tech will not automatically upgrade existing trains because that would potentially destroy moving trains.
	- Moved the mapping of standard and buffed locomotive versions to a dummy technology per Optera's suggestion. Makes adding support for other mods much easier.
	- Added icon graphics for the technology courtesy of Train30.
	- More work towards compatibility with Realistic Electric Trains.

    - Added proper changelog.
