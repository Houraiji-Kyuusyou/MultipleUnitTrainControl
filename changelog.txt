---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.6
Date: 2019-03-30
  Features:
    - Added support for Bob's Logistics trains.
	
  Changes:
    - Reworked cloning code for easier mod support.
    - Moved cloning to data-updates for compatibility with Bob's and other mods, so that updated properties are included in the clone correctly.
	
  Bugfixes:
    - Changed MU Item sort order to work a little better in the signal selection dialog. Still kind of mess with many mods installed.
    - Added MU versions of Electric Train locomotives to the exclude list of the Fuel Train Stop mod.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.5
Date: 2019-03-30
  Features:
    - Added support for magu5026's Electric Train mod.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that blueprint item requests were not preserved on replacement (thanks for the tip, DaveMcW!).
    - Fixed that fuel balancing would be disabled after upgrading from an older version of the mod until you change the NthTick setting.
    - Fixed crash when selecting just rolling stock with the copy tool.
    - Fixed concatenation of localised_description that broke in 0.1.4 by explicitly listing which mods have descriptions and which don't.
	- Fixed pipette tool trying to give MU versions.
  
  Changes:
    - Changed default mode setting to "tech-unlock".
    - Added "script_raised_built" and "script_raised_destroy" flags when replacing locomotives, for inter-mod compatibility.
    - Removed nerf to reversing_power_modifier because it only applies to single-directional trains, which can never have MU version in them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.4
Date: 2019-03-27
  Features:
    - Added support for Angel's Addons - Petrochem Train and Smelting Train. (Smelting Locomotive and Smelting Tender cannot pair with each other.)

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that MU versions were created inside blueprints (thanks for the tip, GotLag!).
    - Fixed that deconstruction orders were not preserved on replacement (only works if being deconstructed by the owning force).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 2019-03-25
  Features:
    - Added French locale courtesy of @kryshnar.

  Changes:
    - Code cleanup.
    - Moved important debug messages to localized strings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2019-03-24
  Features:
    - "Basic MU Control" now can pair locomotives which are separated only by other locomotives.
    - Added "Wireless MU Control" mode, which can pair locomotives anywhere in the train.  L-W-W-L works now!
    - Added support for two technology tiers.  Researching tech will not automatically upgrade existing trains because that would potentially destroy moving trains.
    - Added icon graphics for the technology courtesy of Train30.
    
  Changes:
    - Rewrite of the locomotive pairing algorithms.
    - Moved the mapping of standard and buffed locomotive versions to a dummy technology per Optera's suggestion. Makes adding support for other mods much easier.
