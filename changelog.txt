Version 0.1.2
  Changes:
    - Rewrite of the locomotive pairing algorithm.  "Basic MU Control" now can pair locomotives which are separated only by other locomotives.
	- Added support for "Wireless MU Control", which can pair locomotives anywhere in the train.  L-W-W-L works now!
	- Added support for two-tiered tech unlocks.  Researching tech will not automatically upgrade existing trains because that would potentially destroy moving trains.

    - Fixed that train schedules were not preserved during replacement of a single MU locomotive to a normal locomotive.
    - Fixed that locomotive health was not preserved on replacement.

    - Made normal/MU entity name mapping autogenerated instead of hard-coded.
    - Added proper changelog.
